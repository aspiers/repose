         * minute-long section.

         * In the new model of rate limiting, we use a "fixed window" pattern.

         * necessary to start a new window. This is a much simpler pattern to
         * implement, in that we only have to store one timestamp per limit,
         * rather than one per request. However, it changes the effective
         * behavior of limiting when we consider arbitrary sections of time.
         * Each window has a maximum number of passed requests, but if two
         * windows are close together, and the first has almost all of its

         * This test ensures that repose is tracking requests and times

         * requests per minute. First, we send a single request (which should
         * pass) and sleep for 57 seconds. This will put the next few requests
         * at the end of the window. After sleeping, we get the current system
         * time.
         *
         * Next, we make three requests (2 thru 4). The second and third
         * requests should pass and the fourth should fail. Then we sleep for
         * another 4 seconds, which should reset the limit (57 + 4 > 60).
         *
         * Then, we make four more requests (5 thru 8). The fifth, sixth, and
         * seventh requests should pass, because the limit reset. The eight
         * should fail.
         *
         * Finally, we get the system time again and check that the difference
         * between the two system times is less than one minute.
         *
         * If Repose is using the old model of rate limiting, then the sixth
         * and seventh requests should fail, because they would be within the
         * one-minute window started by the second request.
         *
         * If the difference between the system times is greater than one
         * minute, then the requests took far longer than we were expecting,
         * and it's possible the limit reset at some point. If that happened,
         * then we can't say for sure that the rate limiter is using the right
         * model.
         *
         * If all assertions pass, then we know that the span of time between
         * the two calls to currentTimeMillis contain 2N - 1 = 5 passed
         * requests, and that that span of time is less than a minute long.
